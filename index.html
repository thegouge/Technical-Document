        This guide is for anyone who wants to get into programming, and/or anyone who has chosen web development as their introduction
        to programming
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        JavaScript is ideal for beginners because the syntax is pretty intuitive. If you were to see
        <pre>
<code>if(smart === true) { 
  thought = "I think therefore I am"; 
} 
else { 
  thought = "hurr durr"; 
}
</code>
        </pre> You would probably have some idea of what was going on (if you don't, don't worry, you will after this guide).

        To Quote the MDN Documentation:

        <p class="quote">
          "JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive."
        </p>
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        For those of you who don't know that that means (let's say most of you). JavaScript is
        <i>The</i> Programming language of the Internet. It's built to work in browsers, and has built-in tools to interact
        with websites.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        You can use stuff you do in JavaScript to affect the HTML or CSS of a given webpage (if you don't know what those are, don't
        worry, they won't come up later, but def look them up, they're pretty important).
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        The syntax of how to do that will be outside the scope of this guide, but trust me, that's what JavaScript is used for more
        than half the time
      </p>

      <p class="info">
        So, the easist way to get access to JavaScript is to open up the developer console on your browser (ctrl + shift + j in chrome).
        You can even do it on this page! Go ahead, I'll wait...
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        If you want a blank slate to code JavaScript in, you can type in "about:blank" into your browser address window. Either way,
        try inputting the following code into the console
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>console.log("Hello World!");</code>
      </pre>
      <p class="info">
        once you hit enter, the next line should show the
        <i>string</i> "Hello World!"
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        if it does, you're ready to code!

    <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
      <header class="section-header">Variables</header>
      <p class="info">
        Variables are one of the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript. They are ABSOLUTELY NECCESSARY to understanding JavaScript
        as a whole. Luckily, they're pretty simple as a concept
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        Think of variables as boxes where you can store computer data. you can declare them (or put data into the box)
        <code>var foo = 1;</code>
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        and you can re-declare them (or take out what's in there, and put something else there)
        <code>foo = "bar"</code>
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        Whenever you use these variables in your code, you're essentially dumping the contents of the box right where you wrote the
        variable name. Try this out!
        <pre>
<code>var one = 1;
var two = 2;
var result = one + two;
console.log(result);
</code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        You should see the number '3' in your console after these lines run. And this example works to show you that variables in
        JavaScript work a lot like the variables you know and love in math! (yaaaaaaaaaay, math!).
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        variables can contain various different types of data. such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>numbers</li>
        <li>"strings" (or words)</li>
        <li>booleans (either true or false)</li>
        <li>undefined (essentially nothing)</li>
        <li>null (also nothing)</li>
        <li>symbol (this is a really advanced concept, don't worry about it)</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
        <li>Objects (the "object-oriented" part of JavaScript)</li>
      </ul>
